# Exploratory Data Analysis, Dimensionality Reduction, and Clustering Techniques for Crop Recommendation

## Description

This work was carried out within the framework of the Data Mining course in the University Degree in Artificial Intelligence. It focuses on applying data analysis techniques and unsupervised learning to solve a practical problem related to agriculture and crops. Activities include data analysis, standardization, dimensionality reduction with PCA, use of Isomap and t-SNE, K-Means clustering, and hierarchical clustering. These techniques are applied with the aim of effectively recommending crops based on soil characteristics and the region.

Precision Agriculture (PA) is a farm management strategy based on observing, measuring, and responding to temporal and spatial variability to enhance the sustainability of agricultural production. The research goal in precision agriculture is to define a Decision Support System (DSS) for whole-farm management to optimize input yields while preserving resources.

It aids farmers in making informed decisions about agricultural strategy. Here, a dataset is presented whose analysis would provide users with organized information about factors influencing crops. Additionally, it allows for constructing a model to group crops based on detected patterns depending on various parameters.
